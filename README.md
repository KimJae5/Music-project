Description Amd Instructions:
For my music game, I designed a colourful and playful ui with blocked buttons, each having a face and assigned an eye-catching colour. I wanted to go for a design that children could enjoy and have fun with. The game has a simple enpugh concept of hovering your mouse over one of the buttons and a piano note will be played; you can either hover or click your prefrerred button. The lowest note is the red button and gradually goes up in notes until you reach the pink button which is the highest note that can be played in the game.

Features:
The game includes:
-7 different buttons that will play a note when ypu hover over them or simply click them
-A volume button that can be adjusted using a slider
-An exit button that you press and it will close the tab
